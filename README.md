# thegrid

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application


To run a quick demo of the RPG engine:

/data/generate (run once to fill database)

/game/createCharacter (create sample characters at desired level)

/game/levelup (assign attibute and skill points)

/game/inventory (assign items to characters)

/game/fight (the two first characters in the database fight)
